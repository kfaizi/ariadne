🌱 This is a small software package for analyzing images of _Arabidopsis thaliana_ roots.

📷 It features a GUI for semi-automated image segmentation

☠️ that creates dynamic 2D skeleton graphs of the root system architecture (RSA).

🔍 It's designed specifically to handle complex, messy, and highly-branched root systems well — the same situations in which current methods fail.

📊 It also includes some (very cool) algorithms for analyzing those skeletons, which were mostly developed by other (very cool) people<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>. The focus is on measuring cost-performance trade-offs and Pareto optimality in RSA networks.

⚠️ This is very much a work-in-progress! These are custom scripts written for a small, ongoing research project — so I can't offer any support or documentation yet. 

🔨 That said, if you're interested in tinkering with the code, enjoy! And please reach out with comments, ideas, suggestions, or feedback.
